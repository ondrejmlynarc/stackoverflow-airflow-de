# Stack Overflow Data Pipeline using Airflow

This repository contains a data engineering project demonstrating how to build a data pipeline using Apache Airflow to extract data from Stack Overflow. The focus is on extracting and moving the data of the tag 'cloud', as I was personally curious to analyse the frequency and other data related to different cloud provides (AWS, Azure, Google). 

## Project Overview

In this project, you'll learn how to:

* Set up Apache Airflow
* Use Airflow to schedule and manage workflows
* Extract data from the Stack Overflow API based on the 'cloud' tag
* Process and store data in a database
* Analyze the frequency of cloud-related discussions and tool usage on Stack Overflow

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.6+
* Apache Airflow
* Stack Overflow Developer API Key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/ondrejmlynarc/stackoverflow-data-pipeline.git](https://github.com/ondrejmlynarc/stackoverflow-data-pipeline.git)
   cd stackoverflow-data-pipeline
